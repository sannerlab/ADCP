Build 17:
    10/25/23
    1: BUG related to upper/lower case base amino-acid letter in Crankite resolved. (MS). 
    2: Rotamer file name validation is added.
Build 16:
    10/24/23
    1: adcptools bash command to provide details and other supports.
    2: swiss.lib is removed from default rotamer directory

Build 15:
    10/19/23
    1: Resume minimization looks for omm_temp diectory, to faster reading of already calculated data.
    2: summaryfile_handler (myprint) has new functions like create_backup, delete_backup, check if minimization performed etc.
    3: some bug fixes and rerank by interaction energy option added
    
    10/19/23
    1: Optimized resume Minimization using seperate openMM temp directory
    2: faster single point energy calculation without using 1 step minimization.
    3: Create backup of dlg file in case resumemin fails.
    
Build 14:
    10/6/23        
    1: added writing of a temp energy file for super-quick RESUME MINIMIZATION.
    2: combined get_pre_minimized_data + temp energy file + get_pre_minimized_data_v2 in one for using all informations for faster resume.
    
    10/5/23
    1: added pdb_to_modeller_object for code simplification
    2: added RESUME MINIMIZATION scheme with defs get_pre_minimized_data and get_pre_minimized_data_v2(for future)

Build 13:
    10/4/23
    Minor bug fixing.

Build 12:
    10/4/23
    1: Resume incomplete Minimization steps. using -resumemin option. (required flags -pdmin and remove -O )
        -resumemin cannot be used for new calculations. It is only meant to be used to avoid rerunning minimization
        of complexes that is already performed.
    2: If -pdmin is used (without -resumemin), it will clean all previus minimization data from the dlg file.
    3: my_print does not keep buffer data now. which is required for faster resume of a killed minimization run
    4: BUG for calcFolder is solved. Which was making different directory for -pdmin minimization.
    
Build 11:
    9/5/23
    1: myprint is separated in runADCP and openMM calculations.
    2: Omm raking line also provides score data from docking step.
    3: fix_my_pdb is modified to work with protein-peptide complex and NSTs with hydrogens.[MOST LIKELY OPENMM BUG]
    4: As we are printing ADCP score and OpenMM score together, openMM score unit is changed to kcal/mol.

Build 10:
    Update 9/1/23
    1: NST check in receptors updated 
    
Build 9:    
    Update 8/30/23
    1: updated fix_my_pdb to treat seperately internal and terminal resiudes 
        expecting one type of paramater may not be present
    2: default openMM parameter set is now sannerlab + swiss (for a few NSTs 
        not present in sannerlab). ['sannerlabPLUSswiss']
    3: user can provide their own parameter sets using "-f" flag. Requires 
        <XXX>_ff.xml, <XXX>_hydrogens.xml, <XXX>_residues.xml files in same directory
    4: user can specify specific system parameter set (using -F)and can also restrict use 
       of system parameters by "-F none" option.
    5: multiple modifications in getNamesOfAAandNstsFromSequence to define NST 
       names with terminal tags.
    6: removed scheme to check terminal NSTs for swiss_ff. Now program collects
       the available residues from ffxml file and checks terminal residues with "N/C" tag

Build 8:
    Update 8/29/23
    1: Crankite updated for "-o/-O" check (MS)

Build 7:
    Update 8/25/23
    1: output, working and temp dir related errors resolved (MS).
    2: added -w --workingFolder command line option (MS).


Build 6:
    Update 8/16/23
    1: Suggest correct NST name if case of NST wrong like for "af1" or 'AF1', it will suggest to use "Af1"
    2: Some other bug fixes.
    
    Update 8/16/23
    1: Support for post-docking openMm minimization added. ("-pdmin", "--postDockMinimize")
        ** required combinations 1) -pdmin with -nmin 2) if already minimized file in the directory -pdmin, -nmin and -O

    Update 8/8/23 
    1: Added openMM support for amino-acids with similar graphs e.g. (ALO & THR; ILE & IIL).
    2: Added support for terminal NSTs. using swiss_sannerlab.xml file.
    3: swiss_sannerlab.xml have AMBER compatible partial charges generated from local RED/pyRED server. 
    3: Added scheme to override default hydrogens.xml to avoid conflicts with some NST templates, like for ORN. 
    4: Solved atom-type errors for 2 letter element codes in rotamer files.
    
    Update 7/31/23 
    1: file objects to handle ffxml and rotamer library files.
    2: peptide sequence validations to avoid unknown errors by Crankite.
    3: Coarse potential validation to avoid runtime error for rotamers without default Coarse potentials.
    4: rotamer and ffxml(partially) lookup to find loaded rotamers/ffxml and suggest 
       use of specific rotamer/ffxml files.

    Update 7/26/23
    1: fix_my_pdb loads openMM parameters (bond definition and hydrogen definition)
    (currently only swiss) to support NSTs.
    2: fix_my_pdb returns topology and positions (also) rather than writing a pdb file for faster calculation.
    3: -fnst flag only mutates NSTs that is not present in loaded ffxml file (currently only swiss).
    

Build 1-5:
    Initial implementations and first distributable version.

    

    
TBD:
1: ffxml parameters for all NSTs.
2: clustering of similar atomtypes in ffxml file.
